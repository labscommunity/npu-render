# Full desktop offload: acceptance and execution plan

Updated 2026-10-14. Target: Delta, Windows 11, Panther Lake. The repository stays
private. Full desktop offload is **unfinished**. A native NPU-composed indirect
desktop frame has been produced; a usable switch and a Tahoma benefit have not.

The end state is one switch that moves desktop graphics work to the NPU, retains
physical display scanout, supports normal interaction, and leaves the iGPU
available for Tahoma. Composition, application rendering, video processing, and
display scanout must be measured separately. An indirect display's preferred
renderer does not establish where every application renders.

## Ordered gates

| Gate | Work | Acceptance evidence | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Routing | Record active physical and indirect paths before, during, and after admission; identify clone/extended configuration and actual rendering adapter. | Timestamped topology, native DWM NPU receipts, selected adapter, frame producer, exact restoration. | Automatic clone identified; extension applied with physical path preserved. Compositor failure interrupted clone restoration; final physical baseline restored. |
| 2. Continuous rendering | Keep the native renderer alive across changing windows and content; diagnose every failed draw; distinguish model preparation from rendering and transport. | Multiple changing frames, timestamps and pixel checks, sustained operation, no hidden fallback. | Three changing clone frames: first at 70.8 seconds, then 56.4 and 23.4 seconds apart. Extended-desktop clear rejection under investigation. |
| 3. Physical presentation | Present new NPU frames on the physical output with distinct logical desktops and no recursive mirroring. | Live sequence-to-present correlation, output identity, measured presentation mode and residual GPU work. | Static finite copy probe works; live physical bridge unimplemented. |
| 4. Interaction and recovery | Migrate the logical desktop, route pointer/keyboard/focus correctly, handle cursor/DPI/resolution, restore exact topology and windows. | Scripted interaction visible on physical output; emergency exit and owned-process failure recovery; ordinary login/lock path retained. | VM interaction proof exists; native interaction unqualified. |
| 5. Responsiveness | Optimize resource reuse, graph compilation, dispatch granularity, transfer volume and frame pacing. | Initial target: ordinary desktop interaction at 30 fps, p95 visible response ≤100 ms, 30-minute stable run. Report cold-start time separately. | Not met; several individual draws take seconds. |
| 6. Application coverage | Admit and implement required graphics operations across browser, video and representative 3D workloads. Establish per-process adapter choice. | Capability matrix plus real hardware runs; every remaining iGPU operation accounted for. | General application/video/game migration unqualified. |
| 7. Tahoma benefit | Run repeated baseline/offload trials under matched power, resolution and application load. | Report Tahoma throughput/latency, desktop frame times, per-engine GPU/NPU/CPU activity, memory and power; demonstrate GPU relief and no material Tahoma regression. | Earlier experiments regressed; native desktop A/B not yet run. |
| 8. Usable switch | Integrate qualified components, install/on/off/status, recovery, documentation and CI; resolve distribution signing requirements. | Repeated clean install and enable/disable cycles, sleep/wake and failures, end-to-end test on target hardware. | Research candidates isolated; no usable full-offload product. |

These are engineering acceptance targets, not measured results or an estimated
completion date. Gate 6 remains open if any requested application graphics class
still runs on the iGPU. Physical display scanout is an explicit remaining hardware
role, and any GPU rendering/copy cost in the bridge must be measured.

## Immediate experiment

The [first topology investigation](../validation/2026-10-14/native-topology-progress-v1/README.md)
identified automatic cloning and applied an explicitly extended layout. The
compositor then exited after a rejected clear. The next work is to qualify a
bounded larger clear operation, add failure diagnostics, and repeat extension
with a controller that correctly fails on errors occurring after the first frame.
Live physical feedback remains gated on reliable display separation.

## Architecture constraints from primary documentation

Windows lets an indirect display driver request a rendering adapter; the OS can
select a different one, and the assignment callback reports the actual adapter.
The selected adapter therefore must be checked on each swapchain assignment.
[Microsoft: IddCxAdapterSetRenderAdapter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/iddcx/nf-iddcx-iddcxadaptersetrenderadapter).

The desktop renderer and an application's adapter selection are distinct parts of
the routing decision. A composed frame on the NPU alone cannot demonstrate that
the application's own graphics workload moved.
[Microsoft: IddCx 1.4 rendering adapter preferences](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/iddcx1.4-updates-for-console-and-remote-idds).

Active source/target paths and their associated modes provide the topology evidence.
Virtual-aware path queries require interpreting the corresponding union members
correctly; the current inspector deliberately uses the ordinary active-path query.

## Evidence discipline

Preserve failed trials as well as successes. Record source and binary hashes and
use a new transaction identity for each trial. Keep captured desktop pixels,
models, caches, private addresses, and credentials out of the repository. Commit
only reviewable code and text evidence, using Conventional Commits.
